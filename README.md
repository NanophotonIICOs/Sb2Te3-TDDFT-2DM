# Sb2Te3-TDDFT-2DM
Companion repository for the 2D Materials paper on Linear optical response of monolayer Sb2Te3 under uniaxial strain assessed by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory.  
It provides **reproducibility assets**: input files (Quantum ESPRESSO & YAMBO), processed datasets used in the figures, and plotting scripts in **Julia** (PGFPlotsX based on PGFPlots) and **Python**. 

> This repo lets you regenerate the band-structure plots along Γ–M–K–Γ and the optical spectra at representative strain states (0%, 3%, 5%) from the same raw results discussed in the manuscript.
